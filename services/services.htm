              <p>No matter what condition your home is currently in, all homes will benefit from a staging consultation. A professional and trained set of eyes will greatly increase the likelihood of your home listing and selling for market value or above, and Sanders Design Staging is the company to take you there.</p>
              <p>A staged home will generate more web traffic as well as foot traffic! Additionally buyers are more inclined to view and purchase a home that shows well and looks cared after. <i>Professional</i> and <i>high-quality</i> staging is the way to achieve this. Using a professional stager, your home will appeal to perspective buyers, require little effort on the homeowner’s end, and will ultimately stay on the market for a shorter period of time.</p>
              <p>Additionally, many home stagers overlook dirty windows or spotted carpet. However, Jackie not only pays attention to small details (which to a buyer make a large difference) but has connections with roofers, painters, carpenters, glass work, and a variety of other craftsman – truly a one-stop-shop to help showcase the home at its best.</p>

            <p>Getting a home ready to be sold or just to freshen the space.</p>
            <p>An in-home consultation – typically done with the homeowner – where we walk through your home and identify ways to improve its appeal. If it's a quick fix, such as de-cluttering or rearranging furniture, we'll take care of it on the spot. Some homeowners may prefer to use their existing furnishings and décor. Others may choose to lease additional furnishings that complement the look and design of your home. Whatever your desire and budget, I can identify ways to improve your home's appeal!</p>
