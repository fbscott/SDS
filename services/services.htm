            <p>Getting a home ready to be sold or just to freshen the space.</p>
            <p>An in-home consultation – typically done with the homeowner – where we walk through your home and identify ways to improve its appeal. If it's a quick fix, such as de-cluttering or rearranging furniture, we'll take care of it on the spot. Some homeowners may prefer to use their existing furnishings and décor. Others may choose to lease additional furnishings that complement the look and design of your home. Whatever your desire and budget, I can identify ways to improve your home's appeal!</p>

Jackie uses a local warehouse which specializes in home staging furniture/accessories to rent, for a specified period of time (at a fee charged to the client) to add to existing possessions and includes anything imaginable that may be missing from the finished stage.</p>
